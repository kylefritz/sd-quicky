#StartUp Digest Quicky

Format events for startup digest from a google calendar feed

##TODO
 * descritions got broken somehow... however if we use the full feed instead of basic we can pull all the info directly instead of using Regex
 * change when format to to weekday month day from time to time (Tue Jul 5 from 6pm to 8pm)
 * add functionality to 'approve' event, which updates it with result as description and moves it to production cal
 * change rendering of apostrophes from &#39; to '

##TODONE:

 * ~~shorten links with bit.ly~~
 * ~~order events by date~~
 * ~~handle missing link~~
 * flip by week through listings
